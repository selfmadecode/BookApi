REST is intended to evoke an image of how a well designed web application behaves




REST CONSTRAINTS:
Uniform Interface - API and consumers share one single, technical interface:
	URI, Method, media type (payload)
	Content-Type header is used to signify the type of a payload in the request body
	e.g Application/Json, XML
	Accept header is used by HTTP clients to tell
	the server which type of content they expect/prefer as response.

Manipulation of resources through representations - When a client holds a representation of
	a resource, including any possible meta data, it should have enough information to modify
	or delete the resources on the server, provided it has permission to do so
	...the response should contain the uri to delete, get, post the resource if the api supports
	...the operations
